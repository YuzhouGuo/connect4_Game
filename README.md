# connect4_Game
### "Connect4" is a simple game.
 * You have a vertical grid that is 7-cell-long and 6-cell-high. Each player has some disks of a specific color (yellow for one player, red for the other one). At each round, the player whose turn it is picks a column and puts a disk in that column. The disk falls to the lowest available cell. After one player has played, it is the other playerâ€™s turn.

### This program is a nice practice to deal with 2D arrays and corperation between two classes. 
  * The core part of this assignment is to find the universal rule behind the mathemetical patterns instead of keep making up new conditions, or it's just more and more codes. 
  
No tester file for this program. 
 * Since this is a game, you can always tell whether the algorithm works or not by playing with the machine!
